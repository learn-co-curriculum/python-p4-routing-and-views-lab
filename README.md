# Flask Routing and Views Lab

## Learning Goals

- Build and run a Flask application on your computer.
- Manipulate and test the structure of a request object.

***

## Key Vocab

- **Web Framework**: software that is designed to support the development of
  web applications. Web frameworks provide built-in tools for generating web
  servers, turning Python objects into HTML, and more.
- **Extension**: a package or module that adds functionality to a Flask
  application that it does not have by default.
- **Request**: an attempt by one machine to contact another over the internet.
- **Client**: an application or machine that accesses services being provided
  by a server through the internet.
- **Web Server**: a combination of software and hardware that uses Hypertext
  Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and other protocols to respond to requests made
  over the internet.
- **Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI)**: an interface between web servers
  and applications.
- **Template Engine**: software that takes in strings with tokenized
  values, replacing the tokens with their values as output in a web browser.

## Instructions

> **This is a *test-driven lab*.
<br><br>
Run `pipenv install` to create your virtual environment and `pipenv shell` to enter the virtual environment.
<br><br>
Then `cd` into the `server/` directory and run `pytest -x` to run your tests.
<br><br>
Use these instructions and `pytest`'s error messages to complete your work in the `server/` directory.
<br><br>
If you prefer working in a Flask environment instead of running your application as a script, remember to configure it by running the following commands from the `server/` directory:**

```console
$ export FLASK_APP=app.py
$ export FLASK_RUN_PORT=5555
```

Instructions begin here:

- Design a Flask application that carries out basic Python functions using
  routing and views.
- Your `index()` view should be routed to at the base URL with `/`. It should
  Contain an `h1` element that contains the title of this application, "Python
  Operations with Flask Routing and Views".
- A `print_string` view should take one parameter, a string. It should print
  the string in the console _and_ display it in the web browser. Its URL should
  be of the format `/print/parameter`.
- A `count()` view should take one parameter, an integer. It should display
  all numbers in the `range` of that parameter on separate lines. Its URL
  should be of the format `/count/parameter`.
- A `math()` view should take three parameters: `num1`, `operation`, and `num2`.
  It must perform the appropriate operation on the two numbers in the order that
  they are presented. The included operations should be: `+`, `-`, `*`, `div`
  (`/` would change the URL path), and `%`. Its URL should be of the format
  `/math/<num1>/<operation>/<num2>`.

Once all of your tests are passing, commit and push your work using `git` to
submit.
