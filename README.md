`pytest -x` to run your tests. Use these instructions and `pytest`'s error
messages to complete your work in the `lib/` folder.

Instructions begin here:

- Make sure to specify any class, method, variable, module, package names
  that `pytest` will check for.

Once all of your tests are passing, commit and push your work using `git` to
submit.
